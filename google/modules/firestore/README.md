# Module `google/firestore`

This module offers infrastructure code enabling Google Cloud Firestore on the project.

If Firestore is already enabled on the project, import the existing resource by running the following command from the root module directory:

```sh
terraform import module.firestore.google_app_engine_application.app YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```
